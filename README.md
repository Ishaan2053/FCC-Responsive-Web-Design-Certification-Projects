This GitHub repository contains a collection of projects I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp 'Responsive Web Design' certification curriculum. The Responsive Web Design projects are made using HTML and CSS

Please use this repository as a resource for inspiration and guidance, but do NOT plagiarize the code. It is important to understand the concepts and write your own code to truly learn and improve your skills. Additionally, plagiarism is a violation of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Honor Code and [GitHub's Community Guidelines.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.

* Source code of projects has been slightly altered to prevent plagarism. Build projects on your own. Copying this code will earn you a certification but won't get you the knowledge that comes with it.
